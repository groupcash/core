# Groupcash - Let's play by our own rules

> *Pecunia non olet* - money does not stink.

A saying that might have been true in the ancient Rome is now only that: a saying. Modern money stinks to high heaven. It is a game invented - quite recently - by the rich and mostly played by the rich. It's rules are designed to benefit the ones who have, neglecting and harming the ones who don't. This results is social inequality, unrest and sometimes economic crises.

National currencies are that pervasive, that most people can't even imagine alternatives. But they exist. We can start our own game. One that benefits the community and the underprivileged. We can play by our own rules.



## What's wrong with Money?

So what exactly are the problems with money? The answer to this question lies in the answers to three other questions: Where does it come from? What is its function? And where does it go?


### Where does Money come from?

It is a common misconception that money is created by the government or the central bank. In fact almost all **money is created by private banks** for profits when giving out credits. How is this possible? With a little trick called **fractional-reserve banking**. This allows a bank that has 10 coins gives out 100 coins of credit, *inventing* 90 coins on the way. While gold smiths in the ancient Rome were sentenced to death if caught promising more than they have, it is common practice nowadays almost everywhere in the world. So your money is not only **not backed by anything**, most if it doesn't even exist.

And the bank doesn't lend the 100 coins out of good will. Every **credit costs interests**. If you get those 100 coins from the bank, you'll have to give back 110 coins. Where do these 10 coins come from? More debt. Because almost **all money is created through debt**. The result is that in order to pay the interest, there needs to be more money every year. This is achieved either through inflation or through "growth", meaning that more goods are traded and therefore there can be more money without becoming worth less. A result is that an economy based on interest-carrying debt is **forced to perpetually grow** to avoid inflation, which in turn means that in such a system, **a sustainable economy is impossible**, because the world is finite and can not support infinite growth.

Another problem with this rule of *money only for interest* is that it makes it **easy to get more money if you have money**, and hard if not impossible to get any if you don't have any. The rich get richer, while the poor stay poor. This *negative property tax* benefits only the rich and increases social injustice.


### What is the Purpose of Money?

Economy textbooks tell us that money serves three purposes:

+ **A medium of exchange.** Without money you would have to bring a couple of chickens every time you wanted to acquire vegetables. Money makes our lives a lot easier and our purses a lot lighter.

+ **A unit of account.** How do you know how many tomatoes you can get for a chicken? Money is a common standard that we can use to measure the "worth" of things, like centimetres are a common standard to measure the length of things.

+ **A store of value.** As it turns out, keeping money in the mattress is a lot more convenient than keeping chickens in the garden.

The problem is that we only have one national currency for all three purposes. Why is that a problem? Because these **purposes are not compatible**. To be a good medium of exchange, a currency benefits from a negative interest rate (like inflation) to make people spend it faster. But this makes it a **poor unit of account** and a **poor store of value** because its value decreases over time. Using the same currency as a store of value means that less money is available the market (because its hidden in mattresses) which makes it a **poor medium of exchange**.


### Where does Money go?

Because of the **profit pressure** caused by interest, money tends to always flow in the direction of the most profit. Capital **drains from economically weak regions** towards the nearest financial center, leaving those communities depleted where it's needed the most. And since people follow the money, it also leads to an increased **rural-urban migration**.

And how does it move? Either *physically* by handing over cash or *virtually* by transferring credit between bank accounts. Both ways carry a **transaction cost**. Cash requires transport, and electronic payments impose a **transaction fee**. This fee cannot be avoided because all non-cash transactions **depend on centralized institutions** to keep account of who has how much. These unavoidable costs make **micro-transaction unfeasible**, once again benefiting the rich and limiting the economic options of the small and the poor.



## A new Game

One could think that these rules are universal. That this is just the way the world works and we have to accept this rigged game. But we don't.

We can create a new game with our own rules. We can create a currency that is **run by the community** instead of profit-driven banks. We can decide that this currency should be **backed by delivery promises** of services and real commodities, instead of being created out of thin air. And we can use cryptography (aka "mathematics & computers") to **distribute accounting**, freeing us from centralized institutions.

Such a currency would not try to replace the national currency but **complement** it. It can be used where conventional money does not reach or is not available. It would relief a single currency from having to fulfil contradictory roles.

What we need is a **community currency** that we can shape and design to serve our own needs, that follows our own rules.
