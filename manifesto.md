# Groupcash - Let's play by our own rules

[work in progress]

## Design goals

### Clear value concept

While currencies used to be commodity-backed (e.g. gold standard), this is not any more the case for most. Hence the value of these "political" currencies is mainly make-belief. It's derived from what people believe it's worth and how much they think it will be worth in the future. It also depends on how much they trust the bbanks and government that is guaranteeing the value. A goal of the proposed currency must be that each participant can easily understand and estimate the value of each currency unit.

### Low fluctuation

Fluctuating exchange rates of currencies cause it to be hoarded by investors hoping to make profit. A goal of the proposed currency should be to incentivise circulation and decrease fluctuation. This is compatible with the goal of clear value proposition.

### High velocity

The currency should provide an incentive to keep circulation going, thus preventing hoarding which could lead to a shortage of tradable units and destabilize its value.

### Decentralization

The creation of conventional currencies lies in the hand of a single government body and private banks. Double-spending is avoided through counterfeit-proof tokens (cash) and accounts managed by a few banks. The proposed currency should use a community to collectively create spendable units and prohibit double-spending. The participants should also be able to transfer units independently if wished.

### No transaction fees

Transaction fees harm the economy since they decrease the practical size of transactions. The proposed currency should enable transaction to very low or no costs. The goal of decentralization supports this as well.

### Built on trust

While the main proposition of crypto-currencies like Bitcoin is that no trust is required between the participants in order to trade, this also creates purely profit-driven incentives to participate. In a completely unregulated market, this naturally leads to quasi-monopolies. The proposed currency should provide its users gains from trusting each other and make sure that the self-interest of its participants does not contradict the common interest of the community.



## Implementation

### Useful commodities

The proposed currency is representative, i.e. directly backed by useful commodities. It's units are delivery promises made by value-creating entities. What counts as "useful" must be defined by the community but ideally it would be something with intrinsic value like food, energy or workforce as opposed to merely "rare" substances like gold. Since each unit represents a promise directly, users can decide themselves which commodities they find useful and which backers trust-worthy.

### Regulation

To make sure that the promises comply with the above mentioned definition and also to limit the risk that the backer will not be able to fulfil their promises, a regulatory mechanism is required. This mechanism must make sure that a backer does not sell more promises than they are likely to be able to deliver within a given time frame. For example, a rule could be that a maximum of 10% of the yearly output can be promised. The regulation could either be performed by an organisation or by the community itself.

### Cryptographic signatures

To enable de-centralization, public/private key pairs are used to sign contracts like promises and transactions. Public keys serve as pseudonyms and addresses of the participants. While spending units still relies on the validation of the backer, they cannot change your "balance" without the owners signature.

### Fixed prices

While units can be sold and bought on the open market, backers should guarantee a fixed price. For example $1 per unit. They should also guarantee to buy-back their promises although they may keep a margin.
