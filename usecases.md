# Use-Cases for Groupcash Currencies

The goal of this document is to collect ideas for different use-cases of *groupcash* currencies.

## Time bank

## Local exchange trading

## On-line payment

A *groupcash* currency could be used to transfer wealth electronically without the need for a central authority. Let's call this currency **eCoin**. 

### Actors

There would be four roles involved:

* An **issuer** to regulate the creation of eCoins, let's call her *Marge*.
* A **backer** that receives eCoins for making delivery promises, we call him *Burns*.
* A **merchant** willing to trade eCoins for goods, named *Apu*.
* A **consumer** wanting to use eCoins to buy from the merchant, called *Homer*.

### Example

Homer would like to buy a Doughnut from Apu but is too lazy to go all the way to his shop. Luckily, Apu offers a delivery service but only with eCoins since every other payment method is too expensive for him and eCoins transactions cost nothing or almost nothing. Homer can buy eCoins from Burns.

Burns owns a nuclear power plant that can create more electricity than is current√∂y used so he can sell promises of his unused output in form of eCoins. Marge makes sure that Burns is indeed capable of keeping this promise and decides to give him 100 eCoins backed by a promise of 1000 kWh. This means that Burns promises to provide 10 kWh for each eCoin that somebody gives him.

Homer buys 10 eCoins from Burns for 10 dollars. Since eCoins are files and Burns is old-school, he gives Homer a floppy disk containing his eCoins. Homer saves them to his *groupcash wallet* on his phone with which he can easily transfer 1 eCoin to Apu for one Doughnut.

Apu sends the eCoin to Bunrs to get it confirmed that Homer hasn't spent it already somewhere else. Apu can then either use the eCoin to buy something himself or sell it to another consumer or back to Burns.

### Rules

One rule would be what the currency can be backed by. Marge could decide that only promises of clean energy is accepted and not nuclear power. She could also ask for a fee from Burns for issuing the coins. There also needs to be a rule how the exchange rate between commodities and the currency is determined. It could be based on current market prices. This implies how much each unit costs in terms of national currency. The price could either be fixed or decided by the market. The backer may ask for a fee to confirm coins. He might also keep a percentage when buying back coins.

### Incentives

For Homer eCoins are a convenient way to buy goods. He can also back eCoins himself by offering a food tasting service and thus increase his spending power.

Apu might offer a discount for payment with eCoins since there are no transaction costs, the risk of fraud is close to zero and it supports the community and thus indirectly himself.

Burns can make sell his otherwise unused capacity and thus effectively receives an interest-free loan by selling delivery promises. He may also keep a margin when buying back eCoins.

### Cost recovery

Marge's costs are for evaluating Burns' promises. There are no fixed costs. She can recover her costs by either putting a fee on issuing coins, or by running the account for the backer against a monthly service charge.
