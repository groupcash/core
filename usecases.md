# Use-Cases for Groupcash Currencies

The goal of this document is to collect ideas for different use-cases of *groupcash* currencies. So far it contains a description of incentives for a single use-case.

## Incentives

For each type of user, an incentive must exist to participate in the currency. These incentives must not compromise the common goals described above.

### Backer

Value-creating entities become backers by making delivery promises. Some of them are probably never demanded so selling these promises is a source of capital for the backers which can be invested. Since they receive this loan by a large number of people, it can be compared to crowd-funding. Backers can also gain a margin when buying back their promises.

A backer also has an incentive to prevent double-spending since that would increase the demandable deliveries without receiving compensation. This is done by "validating" a transference.

### Regulator

The regulator bears the costs of acquiring new backers, assuring their compatibility, determining the delivery promise equivalent to one unit and calculating the maximum number of units they may issue. This could be compensated by a fee per created units, decreasing the sell/buy margin of the backers. Another source of revenue could be to manage the accounts of the backers, either charging for this service or keeping the margins.

### Merchant

By accepting the proposed currency, merchants benefit from a faster, more secure and cheaper mean of payment. Because of the guaranteed buy-back by the backers, the only risk is the buy/sell margin and thus small and calculate-able. Merchants can also promote under-used assets by accepting part of the payment in the local currency.

### Consumer

Consumers benefit from a faster, cheaper way of payment as well. Because of the fixed prices, units can be bought with no loss. Units could also be sold at a discount.
